# Stat 3302 Project: 2001 Barry Bonds Plate Appearances

INTRODUCTION
------------

This project focuses on exploratory data analysis, model building, selection, and diagnostics for 2001 Barry Bonds Plate Appearances. Last updated: March 2016.

EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
-------------------------

Our initial steps in the exploratory data analysis phase was to familiarize ourselves with the data. After this process, we started to look at general trends in the data. One of the first models we fit was with Bonds' probability of getting on base vs. if there are other individuals present on base. This model produced a statistically significant relationship.
